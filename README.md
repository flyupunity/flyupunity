## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an indie developer on Unity, I know the basics of Python, I work on Scratch for fun, I create something simple on Arduino.

I participate in Brackeys Game Jam twice a year, at the end of the game jam I post the game on itch.io (https://fly-up.itch.io/), and the source code on GitHub (https://github.com/flyupunity).

I create some projects and games separately in order to learn something new, I publish some on GitHub, Yandex Games, Itch.io, YouTube, etc.
